# Capstone-UI

For the Capstone project, the team is working with Mott MacDonald Canada Limited (MM), a global engineering and management consultancy, to address the need for incorporating COVID-19 data into an interactive navigation tool.

This is a video demo of the user interface design of our COVID-19 navigation web-app tool that outputs navigations for pedestrians to best avoid crowdedness on streets. Upon starting the web-app, the user will be able to answer some navigation-specific questions in a pop-up questionnaire, the tool will then calculate the best routes based on the user's preferences. 


The video only demonstrates the walking navigation routes. However, the team has also added a transit navigation option, and is working on finalizing the tool for the final Capstone showcase in May.
